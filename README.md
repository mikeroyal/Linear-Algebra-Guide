  Linear Algebra Guide
</h1>

#### The purpose of this guide is to give you an introduction to the mathematical operations that we can perform on vectors and matrices and to give you a feel of the power of linear algebra. A lot of complex problems in science, business, and technology can be described in terms of vectors and matrices so it's important that people understand how it all works.

[Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) is the math of vectors and matrices. The only prerequisite for this guide is a basic understanding of high school math concepts like numbers, variables, equations, and the fundamental arithmetic operations on real numbers: addition (denoted +), subtraction (denoted −), multiplication (denoted implicitly), and division (fractions). Also, you should also be familiar with functions that take real numbers as inputs and give real numbers as outputs, f : R → R.

## i. Vector operations

We now define the math operations for vectors. The operations we can perform on vectors ~u = (u1, u2, u3) and ~v = (v1, v2, v3) are: addition, subtraction, scaling, norm (length), dot product, and cross product:

The dot product and the cross product of two vectors can also be described in terms of the angle θ between the two vectors.

### ii. Matrix operations

We denote by A the matrix as a whole and refer to its entries as aij .The mathematical operations defined for matrices are the following:

• determinant (denoted det(A) or |A|)
Note that the matrix product is not a commutative operation.

### iii. Matrix-vector product

The matrix-vector product is an important special case of the matrix product.

There are two fundamentally different yet equivalent ways to interpret the matrix-vector product. In the column picture, (C), the multiplication of the
matrix A by the vector ~x produces a linear combination of the columns of the matrix: ~y = A~x = x1A[:,1] + x2A[:,2], where A[:,1] and A[:,2] are the first and second columns of the matrix A. In the row picture, (R), multiplication of the matrix A by the vector ~x produces a column vector with coefficients equal to the dot products of rows of the matrix with the vector ~x.

The matrix-vector product is used to define the notion of a linear transformation, which is one of the key notions in the study of linear algebra. Multiplication by a matrix A ∈ R m×n can be thought of as computing a linear transformation TA that takes n-vectors as inputs and produces m-vectors as outputs:

# Computing the Inverse of a Matrix
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Linear-Algebra-Guide#table-of-contents)

In this section we’ll look at several different approaches for computing the inverse of a matrix. The matrix inverse is unique so no matter which
method we use to find the inverse, we’ll always obtain the same answer.

# Other Linear Topics
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Linear-Algebra-Guide#table-of-contents)

In this section discuss a number of other important topics of linear algebra.

### i. Basis

Intuitively, a basis is any set of vectors that can be used as a coordinate system for a vector space. You are certainly familiar with the standard basis for the xy-plane that is made up of two orthogonal axes: the x-axis and the y-axis.

<p align="center">

  <br />
</p>

### iii. Dimension and Basis for Vector Spaces

The dimension of a vector space is defined as the number of vectors in a basis for that vector space. Consider the following vector space S = span{(1, 0, 0),(0, 1, 0),(1, 1, 0)}. Seeing that the space is described by three vectors, we might think that S is 3-dimensional. This is not the case, however, since the three vectors are not linearly independent so they don’t form a basis for S. Two vectors are sufficient to describe any vector in S; we can write S = span{(1, 0, 0),(0, 1, 0)}, and we see these two vectors are linearly independent so they form a basis and dim(S) = 2. There is a general procedure for finding a basis for a vector space. Suppose you are given a description of a vector space in terms of m vectors V = span{~v1, ~v2, . . . , ~vm} and you are asked to find a basis for V and the dimension of V. To find a basis for V, you must find a set of linearly independent vectors that span V. We can use the Gauss–Jordan elimination procedure to accomplish this task. Write the vectors ~vi as the rows of a matrix M. The vector space V corresponds to the row space of the matrix M. Next, use row operations to find the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the matrix M. Since row operations do not change the row space of the matrix, the row space of reduced row echelon form of the matrix M is the same as the row space of the original set of vectors. The nonzero rows in the RREF of the matrix form a basis for vector space V and the numbers of nonzero rows is the dimension of V.

### iv. Row space, columns space, and rank of a matrix

Recall the fundamental vector spaces for matrices that we defined in Section II-E: the column space C(A), the null space N (A), and the row space R(A). A standard linear algebra exam question is to give you a certain matrix A and ask you to find the dimension and a basis for each of its fundamental spaces. In the previous section we described a procedure based on Gauss–Jordan elimination which can be used “distill” a set of linearly independent vectors which form a basis for the row space R(A). We will now illustrate this procedure with an example, and also show how to use the RREF of the matrix A to find bases for C(A) and N (A).

### vii. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

The set of eigenvectors of a matrix is a special set of input vectors for which the action of the matrix is described as a simple scaling. When a matrix is multiplied by one of its eigenvectors the output is the same eigenvector multiplied by a constant A~eλ = λ~eλ. The constant λ is called an eigenvalue of A.

[Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is an approach to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.
